  "post1Body": "<h2>When to use each method</h2><p>Use soft washing for delicate surfaces like painted siding, stucco, or older brick. Reserve pressure washing for hard surfaces like concrete, pavers, and some stone where higher PSI is safe.</p><h3>Our approach</h3><ul><li>Low-pressure application of detergents to lift organics</li><li>Gentle rinse for a like-new finish</li><li>Pre-wet landscaping and post-rinse to protect plants</li></ul>",
  "post2Body": "<h2>Why soft wash for roofs?</h2><p>Asphalt shingles and many metal roofs can be damaged by high PSI. Our soft wash kills algae at the root and removes streaks without lifting granules.</p><h3>What we treat</h3><ul><li>Gloeocapsa magma (black streaks)</li><li>Moss and lichen</li><li>General rooftop grime</li></ul>",
  "post3Body": "<h2>Restore curb appeal</h2><p>Concrete and driveways accumulate oil, rust, and organic staining. We use surface cleaners and precise detergents to deep-clean without etching.</p><h3>Common results</h3><ul><li>Oil and tire mark reduction</li><li>Mildew removal</li><li>Brightened joints and edges</li></ul>",
  "post4Body": "<h2>What causes tiger stripes</h2><p>Electrostatic bonding and run-off can leave dark vertical streaks on gutters. Our whitening process removes oxidation and restores brightness.</p><h3>Process</h3><ol><li>Gentle detergent application</li><li>Soft agitation</li><li>Controlled rinse</li></ol>",
  "post5Body": "<h2>Make a strong first impression</h2><p>Clean storefronts, walkways, and signage invite customers in. We schedule around foot traffic and business hours for minimal disruption.</p><h3>Commercial focus</h3><ul><li>Gum and stain removal</li><li>Sidewalks and entries</li><li>Building facades and awnings</li></ul>",
  "post6Body": "<h2>Season-by-season plan</h2><p>Use this simple schedule to protect exterior surfaces year-round.</p><h3>Spring</h3><ul><li>House rinse and siding soft wash</li><li>Deck and fence cleaning</li></ul><h3>Summer</h3><ul><li>Driveway and patio cleaning</li><li>Gutter face touch-ups</li></ul><h3>Fall</h3><ul><li>Roof soft wash (as needed)</li><li>Pre-winter mildew treatment</li></ul>",
